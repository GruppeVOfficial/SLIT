YOUTUBE TUTORIAL: (COMING SOON)

1. Fork the project.
2. Clone your fork to your computer.
3. Create a branch for your new feature.
4. Make your changes.
    * Avoid making changes to more files than necessary for your feature (i.e. refrain from combining your "real" pull request with incidental bug fixes). This will simplify the merging process and make your changes clearer.
5. Commit your changes and push your branch to your fork.
    * You may want to pull in the lastest project games from the upstream master before pushing your own changes, to ensure that you are up to date.
6. Make a "Pull Request" from your branch here on Github.
    * Include screenshots demonstrating your change if applicable.
